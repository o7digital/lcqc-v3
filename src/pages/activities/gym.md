Where movement meets mindfulness. Bathed in natural light and open to the ocean breeze, our gym invites you to reconnect with your energy while gazing over Zihuatanejo Bay.

From state-of-the-art cardio to thoughtful strength and stretching zones, every detail is designed to help you feel stronger, lighter, and more present.

Begin at sunrise or unwind at sunset â€” let the rhythm of the bay set your pace.
