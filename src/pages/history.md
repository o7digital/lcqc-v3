**Founded in 1992, overlooking Zihuatanejo Bay, La Casa Que Canta was born as an intimate, handcrafted retreat, conceived as an ode to romance, serenity, and Mexican art.**

Perched above the sweeping views of La Ropa Beach, this exclusive adults-only boutique hotel houses 25 suites spread across three buildings, many with private pools and terraces offering 180-degree ocean panoramas. Each suite is unique: hand-decorated with terracotta, tiles, Talavera, and clay, inspired by Mexican folk art and tradition, creating an atmosphere of total privacy and authenticity.

The hanging gardens, stairways descending toward hidden nooks, and its two distinctive pools—an infinity pool and a natural seawater pool carved into the rock—invite guests to discover a universe designed with meticulous attention to detail and profound respect for well-being.

The hotel rose to international fame as the filming location of the iconic Hollywood movie *When a Man Loves a Woman*, starring Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia, cementing its reputation as a symbol of romance on Mexico’s Pacific coast.

In addition to its suites, La Casa Que Canta offers three exclusive Luxury Villas: **El Murmullo, El Ensueño, and Villa de la Roca.** These private residences, available for rent, give guests the opportunity to enjoy an even more authentic and personalized experience, where luxury blends seamlessly with intimacy, art, and the essence of the place.

The **Mar & Cielo** restaurant, suspended above the sea, offers a gastronomic experience under the moonlight and the sound of the waves. Its menu combines the best of contemporary Mexican cuisine with a subtle European touch, featuring signature dishes such as shrimp pozole, guajillo shrimp with mushrooms, and baked fish in banana leaf with pineapple, onion, habanero chili, and jasmine.

**Today, La Casa Que Canta remains a sanctuary of intimacy, beauty, and authenticity, where every stay becomes a profound encounter with nature, art, and the spirit of Mexico.**
