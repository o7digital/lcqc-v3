Perched above the Pacific, this stunning seawater infinity pool seems to melt into the ocean and its endless horizon. With a commanding view over the bay of Zihuatanejo, it invites you to feel suspended between sea and sky, where time slows down and every reflection dances with the light.

Just steps away from the bar and the restaurant, it is a place to bask in the warmth of the sun, savour a cocktail at sunset, or simply let the rhythm of the waves cradle your thoughts.

Here, the horizon is not a limit: it is an experience.
